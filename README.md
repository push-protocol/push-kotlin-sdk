<h2>Push Kotlin SDK </h2> 
<p>
Push SDK provides an abstraction layer to integrate Push protocol features with your Frontend as well as Backend.
This SDK is a kotlin based repo of packages that helps developers to :

- Build PUSH features into their DApps
  - Notifications
  - Chat
  - Group Chat
  
without having to write a lot of boilerplate code. All the heavy lifting is done by the SDK, so that you the developer can focus on building features and bootstrap a DApp with PUSH features in no time!
